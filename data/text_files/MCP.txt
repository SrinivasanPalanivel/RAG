 Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Definition
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol introduced by OpenAI to allow Large Language Models (LLMs) to safely interact with external tools, databases, and APIs through standardized interfaces.
It defines how an AI model can request, retrieve, or manipulate contextual information — like documents, data, or actions — without exposing sensitive systems directly.

Core Idea
MCP allows a model to fetch and use real-time context safely and dynamically.
It’s a bridge between the model and connected data sources or services.

Architecture Workflow
The MCP server hosts tools, APIs, or data sources.
The client model (LLM) connects to the MCP server.
The model requests context or actions (e.g., "fetch user account info" or "search documents").
MCP standardizes data exchange using JSON schemas and security protocols.

Components
Component	Description
MCP Server	Provides data/tools (e.g., file system, databases, APIs).
MCP Client	The LLM or app that consumes context from MCP.
MCP Protocol	Defines structured JSON-based message formats for safe communication.

Key Features
Secure Access Control — Models only see what’s allowed.
Standardized Interface — Works with any data source or tool.
Extensible Design — Easy to add new connectors.
Compatible with RAG — MCP can serve as the data bridge in a RAG pipeline.

Use Case Example
Use Case:
A customer service assistant powered by GPT-5 retrieves user account details via MCP instead of embedding sensitive data in the prompt.

Flow:
LLM requests account info from the MCP server.
MCP authenticates and fetches from CRM DB.
Response is securely sent back to the LLM.
LLM uses it to generate a compliant, data-grounded reply.
