 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Definition
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI architecture pattern that enhances a language model’s responses by integrating external knowledge retrieval.
It ensures that model outputs are fact-based, up-to-date, and contextually relevant, rather than relying solely on the model’s internal training data.

Core Concept
RAG combines:
Retriever → Fetches relevant documents or data from a knowledge base (like PDFs, databases, APIs, or embeddings).
Generator → Uses that retrieved data to produce a final, contextually enriched answer.

Workflow
User Query → "What is the refund policy of ABSA Bank?"
Retriever → Searches a document store (e.g., vector DB like Pinecone, FAISS, Chroma) for relevant policy text.
Context Injection → The retrieved data is appended to the prompt.
Generator (LLM) → Produces an answer grounded in the retrieved content.

Advantages
Provides factual grounding.
Enables domain-specific responses.
Reduces hallucination risk.
Allows updatable knowledge without retraining the model.
