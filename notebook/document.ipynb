It provides a structured way to \\nwrite code that is maintainable, reusable, and scalable. \\nThink of it as a blueprint or a best practice that developers follow to solve recurring design issues efficiently. \\nWhy Do We Need Design Patterns? \\n1. Improves Code Reusability – Common solutions can be applied across different projects. \\n2. Enhances Maintainability – Code becomes structured and easy to understand. \\n3. Reduces Code Duplication – Encourages reusing existing patterns instead of reinventing solutions. \\n4. Supports Scalability – Helps in designing software that can grow without major changes. \\n5. Follows SOLID Principles – Many patterns help implement SOLID principles effectively. \\nTypes of Design Patterns (with Examples) \\n1. Creational Patterns – Focus on object creation. \\no Singleton – Ensures only one instance of a class (e.g., Logger, Database Connection). \\no Factory Method – Creates objects without specifying the exact class. \\no Builder – Helps create complex objects step by step. \\n2. Structural Patterns – Focus on class and object composition. \\no Adapter – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. \\no Decorator – Adds new behavior dynamically. \\n3. Behavioral Patterns – Focus on communication between objects. \\no Strategy – Allows selecting an algorithm at runtime (e.g., different sorting techniques). \\no Observer – Used for event-driven programming (e.g., Notification System). \\nKey Takeaways \\n✔ Design Patterns make software development easier and more efficient. \\n✔ They provide reusable solutions to common problems. \\n✔ Used in web development, automation testing, mobile apps, and more. \\n \\nSINGLETON CLASS PATTERN \\nWhat is the Singleton Pattern in Java? \\nThe Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global \\naccess point to that instance. \\n💡 Example: Imagine a Printer Spooler in a computer system.

If a Singleton class \\nimplements Serializable, Java allows deserialization to create a new instance, bypassing the Singleton pattern. \\nTo prevent this, we override the readResolve() method. \\nExample: \\n// Prevents creating a new instance on deserialization \\n    protected Object readResolve() { \\n        return INSTANCE; \\n    } \\nTo prevent a serialization attack in Singleton, we implement readResolve(), which ensures that during \\ndeserialization, the existing instance is returned instead of creating a new one.

The clone() method in Object creates a new \\ninstance, violating the Singleton pattern. To prevent this, we override clone() and throw an exception. \\nExample: \\n @Override \\n    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException { \\n        throw new CloneNotSupportedException(\"Cloning is not allowed for Singleton!\"); \\n    }'),\n",
